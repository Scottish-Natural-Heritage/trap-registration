			<p class="govuk-body">This service is for existing registration holders. You must use a different service to <a class="govuk-link" href= "{{pathPrefix}}/start">apply for a new trap registration</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Trap registrations are changing</h2>

			<p class="govuk-body">A new licence is being introduced by the Wildlife Management and Muirburn (Scotland) Act 2024.</p>

			<p class="govuk-body">In future, you will need to complete a training course before applying for a wildlife trap licence to use traps to catch birds or spring traps to catch mammals.</p>

			<p class="govuk-body">Until the new licence is launched (expected in 2025), we will only issue temporary trap registrations for the use of Larsen Traps, Larsen Mate Traps, Larsen Pod Traps and multi-catch crow traps under our General Licences.</p>
